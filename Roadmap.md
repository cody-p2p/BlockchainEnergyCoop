## Welcome users

Thanks for taking the time to read the RULES:

+ refunds are possible with proper information.

## Foundation ( Blockchain Energy Coop )

To create a p2p socket threaded network for distrabuting power via a micro grid adhoc aero network.

- Establish Networks
  + create new networks
 eq ( create new networks via a custom protocol )

- Setup Power Modules
  + Hardware Based Technology
    eq( look at this computer panel )

- Connect Interfaces
  + From SYSTEM @Via hardware panel connect setup/tools.exe
  eq( run the OS for setup tools to complete via virtual box program or better. )

- Relay Test Service

Send initial blockchain network for informational systems only and fair usage records
a zero trust policy login required for access to network and systems.

Zero ID is given unless otherwise noted here.
NOTE: Cody James CJ provides maintainace for overview.

- Setup WIFI nodes

    SSID: Local-Share
PASSHASH: ******

- Blockchain GPU Cards

RTX-600 x 12 via a desktop pc windows 11
  - sub-node0-12 x HASHPASS: 999^
    > Main Menu Mods
  - with programming mods enabled
  
## Mods and External Engine Requirements
The mods included should be safe unless otherwise noted
the system windows 11 will not NOT allow you to run them.
However some tutorials show how to bypass this We do not NOT recommend
doing so as there is a better and safer way to achieve the desired results.

+ Virutal Box 7
  
## VirtualBox7
This containerization program is used in the OS toolchain
it is used for operating other linux distros or windows source code CDs
it could also be used to run other OS ( Operating Systems ) such as servers
web services IOT and other modified hardwares.
  
## Usage

The user setup is to configure the power sharing module on the main interface panel
marked green. The user simply turns on device and setup configuration takes place.

namespace: localhost-BCCB-protocol
    local: share network required login
      opt: code 101

username: ******
password: ******

service.api.username.com > goto localhost WLAN setup/tools.exe -> runtime OS required

## Optional Share Project

With better allocation of services users can generate a standard unit of energy
from the solar distrabution system and power their homes ( offgrid technology cluster )
These technology clusters can be wide area networks or WLANS for shortcode.

## Time is a factor 
... when setup for service is required

The test network would need to be setup first,
then you could see a common result desired.

```
import system
use setup_tools
return 0

```
